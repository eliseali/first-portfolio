<h2>My top 3 current hobbies.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Painting with Gouche</h3>
<p>I've always wanted to explore painting with 
gouche, but I never had the chance, so I'm really glad I have the chance now.</p>

<h3>Scrapbooking</h3>
<p>I've never been able to find a term for this, but I've always loved to combine making pretty bullet journal layouts
with journaling.
</p>

<h3>Digital Art</h3>
<p>I wanna keep exploring a glitchy art style that's a bit more imperfect.</p>
