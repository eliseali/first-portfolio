<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Elise, a creative-type interested in learning more about the world of design, and how to approach digital problems from a human-centric perspective. I’m currently studying Informatics and Psychology at UCI.</p>

<p>Outside of design I can be found honing my skills in dance, collecting adorable plushies, and convincing my friends I don’t have a boba addiction.</p>
